            Relay is an up-and-coming <strong>Social Content Network</strong>. All the features you've come to expect from the establishment networks can be found in Relay. Feeds, comments, user groups, forums. But this is Relay, so...
            you can customize your profile page to the last HTML tag. You can set up a small (or big) business website that will live on the relay network for free for ever. You can get involved in Public Votes or Community Calls to Action. You can write new relay scripts to further enrich the social experience. <i>Now that's social networking!</i>

            Relay is <strong>Content</strong>. The Relay <strong>KeySpace</strong> is a paradigm shift in web content delivery. Using the latest browser technology, content loads instantly via always-on two-way socket communication. Using PGP Encryption, relay content is verified automatically and cannot be faked or manipulated in any way. Only the original author has the power to change their KeySpace Content. Content consists of anything from feed posts, to personal web pages, business functionality, even a technology sandbox. <i>It's your KeySpace.</i>

            Relay is <strong>Privacy</strong>. By default you can't see anyone and no one can see you. Like any social network, you add friends and contacts and determine what level of access each user has to your KeySpace. No fire walls. No data leaks. No state surveillance. <i>You have Control</i>

            Relay is <strong>Reputation</strong>. Once you create a PGP Identity, it can never be altered or faked. Public identities created for the purposes of delivering consumer content will inevitably build a strong reputation among that user base. <i>Your Brand is your Reputation.</i>

            Relay is <strong>Democracy</strong>. Anyone can contribute. All developmental decisions occur in a public space subject to community audits. Relay will never be sold, shelved, or repurposed and will exist as long as it has a user base. <i>It's your call</i>

            Relay is <strong>Business</strong>. Small and Large Business alike benefit by taking advantage of free Enterprise-level functionality in Relay. Whether the goal is a quick and simple business card webpage, or a feature-rich ecommerce shop with cart and payment options, or just live customer support, Relay is the way to go. No server maintenance. No staff overhead. No costs at all. <i>Just business</i>

            Relay is <strong>Centralized</strong>. While Relay is technically 'decentralized software', one of its design parameters is to centralize all communication. Unlike IRC which allows unique channels in each server, all Relay channels are unified (centralized via smart networking). <i>Together is better</i>

            Relay is <strong>Local</strong>. Once you're ready to meet people, Relay offers communication in every conceivable category. You can join channels based on interest, locality (like timezone or town), or make up your own. Quickly and easily find like-minded people in a controlled and safe chat environment. <i>Unleash the power of Community Source</i>

            Relay is the next step for <strong>Push Notification</strong> technology. Current push notification systems operate one-way from server to client. Relay pushes in all directions, server to clients, client to servers, client to clients (thousands, millions, there's no limit). It's up to you. This translates into a significantly more interactive internet experience for the end user. Page loads become obsolete and instantaneous UI becomes the norm. <i>Relay waits for you.</i>
