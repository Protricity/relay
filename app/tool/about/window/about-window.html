    Free and Community Owned
    Always free, forever
    Cannot be owned, sold, shelved, or reappropriated without the community's consent
    All matters (executive, budget, etc) are audited by the community in real-time

    Open-Source
    Anyone can contribute
    Donations go to contributors of the repository (programmers, designers, content editors, anyone)


    Decentralized
    No single points of failure
    Most features will continue working during outages

    Keypair Encryption (with PGP)
    The fundamental aspect of what makes Relay possible has to do with client-side encryption.
    All content is signed with the creator's private key.
    Signatures cannot be faked
    As information is relayed through the network, the authenticity of that information is constantly verified via the creator's public key
    Private messages and content encrypted with strong PGP encryption cannot be broken or read by anyone other than the intended recipient. Client-side to Client-side encryption prevents man-in-the-middle attacks as well as anyone (ISP, government, corporations) from snooping your private data


    Simple Stack
    The Relay client uses a modern browser and is built on JavaScript and HTML5
    The Relay 'cache' server uses Javascript also and runs on Node.js and is used to relay socket information and cache http requests


    Features
    KeySpace
    Every User has a User KeySpace that can optionally host entire websites and online services from a single device
    Content is cached in socket servers so that a host device may be offline for long periods of time without the end users experiencing any outages.
    Small businesses can host all their content for free forever using many available templates, and even serve transactional requests via POST all from a single device
    Users may customize (or design from scratch) anything in their KeySpace. They can also select by default templates that resemble existing social media networks (Facebook, Myspace templates, etc)

    User Feed
    Similar to Myspace/Facebook, any content posted to the User KeySpace also appears on their User Feed. The User Feed is simply a list of all posts made in chronological order. Content access is up to the content creator and managed via PGP Encryption
    Similar to other services, the user feed provides common features like comments, signing content (similar to like)


    Chatrooms
    IRC-styled Chatrooms with HTML5 awesomeness
    Chat rooms provide event push-notification and can act as side-loaded support to all other features built on Relay
    Chat rooms can be joined based on locality (country, state, city, house, ip, timezone)

    Cryptocurrency integration
    Bitcoin (and other currencies) create a user-run economy that operates within the community.
    Financial incentive can be used to stimulate such initiatives as voting and software projects

    Vote System
    Vote initiatives signal community calls to action and can be initiated by any user.
    Voter identity and value is protected via PGP Encryption
    Voter fraud is regulated by community audits of vote receipts
    Financial incentive can be used to promote a public vote by incentivizing users to vote, review and debate on issues, and audit vote receipts
    Votes are tallied and protected by vote registrars who are responsible for auditing and tallying all votes under their account. This is all handled automatically. In the event of fraud, a review of voter identities is triggered. Failing to do this may result in all votes in the hierarchy becoming invalidated. Anyone can be a vote registrar, but trust comes down to reputation.
    Vote receipts are periodically updated with public-facing hashes that do not give away the voter's identity or vote value, but do allow for duplicate votes to be detected. Fraud that may have gone undetected may be found after the fact when new hash algorithms become available.
