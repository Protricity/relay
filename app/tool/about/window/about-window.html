            Relay is an up-and-coming <strong>Social Content Network</strong>. All the features you've come to expect from the big brands can be found within Relay such as feeds, comments, user groups, forums, but Relay offers much more...

            Relay is <strong>Customization</strong>.  Create your profile 'space' and customize its content to the last HTML tag. With Relay, you can set up a small (or big) business website that will live on the relay network for-free and forever. You can get involved in activities through Relay like Public Votes or Community Calls to Action or even write your own new relay scripts to further enrich the social experience. Taking social networking to the next level.

            Relay is <strong>Content</strong>. The Relay KeySpace is a paradigm shift in web content delivery. Using the latest browser technology, content loads instantly via always-on two-way socket communication. Using PGP Encryption, relay content is verified automatically and cannot be faked or manipulated in any way. Only the original author has the power to change their KeySpace Content. Content consists of anything from feed posts, to personal web pages, business functionality, even a technology sandbox. It's your KeySpace.

            Relay is <strong>Privacy</strong>. By default you can't see anyone and no one can see you. Like any social network, you add friends and contacts and determine what level of access each user has to your KeySpace. No fire walls. No data leaks. No state surveillance. You have Control.

            Relay is <strong>Reputation</strong>. Once you create a PGP Identity, it can never be altered or faked. Public identities created for the purposes of delivering consumer content will inevitably build a strong reputation among that user base. Your Brand is your Reputation.

            Relay is <strong>Democracy</strong>. Anyone can contribute. All developmental decisions occur in a public space subject to community audits. Relay will never be sold, shelved, or repurposed and will exist as long as it has a user base. It's your call.

            Relay is <strong>Business</strong>. Small and Large Business alike benefit by taking advantage of free Enterprise-level functionality in Relay. Whether the goal is a quick and simple business card webpage, or a feature-rich ecommerce shop with cart and payment options, or just live customer support, Relay is the way to go. No server maintenance. No staff overhead. No costs at all. Just business.

            Relay is <strong>Unifying</strong>. Although decentralized in design, all Relay servers are purposed with centralizing the flow of information. On the Relay network, channels of information are unified (via smart networking), and users are only ever one degree of separation away from their destination, or each other. Together is better.

            Relay is <strong>Local</strong>. Once you're ready to meet people, Relay offers communication in every conceivable category. You can join channels based on interest, locality (like timezone or town), or make up your own. Quickly and easily find like-minded people in a controlled and safe chat environment. Unleash the power of Community Source.

            Relay is the <strong>Cloud</strong>. By design, Relay has no single points of failure. As the Relay Network grows, more servers around the world will be added to the master list dramatically increasing user capacity and bandwidth. Unlike the Cloud, data redundancy exists on the user clients rather than on the servers, reducing dependence on expensive, fast, high-capacity servers and endless hard drive mirroring.

            Relay is a <strong>BlockChain</strong>. Similar to modern cryptocurrencies, the Relay Network consists of an endless stream of user entries linked by verifiable encryption (a blockchain). Individual entries refer to each other up and down the blockchain and coalesce into meaningful data interpreted by the user's client. Once something is sent (relayed) across the network, it cannot be altered, faked or lost.

            Relay is not a <strong>Walled Garden</strong>. Designed to adapt to new technologies as they surface, Relay developers will not close any doors or windows to new ideas, and will resist any attempts by outside influences to wrest control away from the community. Instead, the developers have an obligation to consider to the best available solution, allow competing solutions, benefiting everyone with the power of Community Source

            Relay is the next step for <strong>Push Notification</strong> technology. Current push notification systems operate one-way from server to client and tend to require scalable infrastructure. Relay pushes in all directions, server to clients, client to servers, client to clients (thousands, millions, there's no limit). It's up to you. This translates into a significantly more interactive event-driven internet experience for the end user. Page loads become obsolete and instantaneous UI becomes the norm. Relay waits for you.
